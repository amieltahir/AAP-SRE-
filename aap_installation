Here’s a quick sanity checklist before you launch the playbooks:

Nodes:

controller01 – Controller/Task orchestrator
hub01 – Hub node
exec01 – Execution node
db01 – Database node

Connectivity:

Passwordless SSH from controller01 → hub01, exec01, db01
Local VM can SSH into controller01 (or any node) using ~/.ssh/config.

Prerequisites:

You have the AAP 2.4 installer bundles locally on the controller node.
Python 3 installed on all nodes (required for Ansible modules).
Required ports open: 22 (SSH), 80/443 (web), 5432 (Postgres), etc.

Inventory:
Already simplified: just hostnames (controller01, hub01, exec01, db01) because SSH config handles IPs and keys.

Ansible Playbooks:

You can start with a playbook that uploads the installer bundles to each node.
Then a second playbook to run the installation: controller first, database, hub, then execution nodes.
Ensure idempotency: if a playbook fails, you can rerun without breaking the setup.

Local VM:

Use your simplified inventory and SSH config.
No --private-key needed since SSH config has the key path.

Lab Setup & Self-Signed SSL Certificates

Scope: Runs on all nodes (controller01, exec01, hub01, db01).

Steps:

Set the hostname on each node to match its inventory name (controller01, exec01, etc.).

Update /etc/hosts to add entries for all nodes, so local DNS works in the lab (controller01.techroute.io, etc.).

Create a directory for SSL certs (/etc/ssl/techroute) on each node.

Generate a self-signed certificate for each node:

Each cert uses the node’s hostname and domain (*.techroute.io).

Certificates are valid for 1 year (365 days).

Metadata added (organization, location, country, etc.) for realism.

Set strict permissions on the certs and private keys so only root can read them.

2️⃣ Distribute Certificates & Keys

Scope: Runs from your control machine (localhost) to all nodes.

Steps:

Copy each node’s certificate to its respective node.

Copy each node’s private key to its respective node.

Set strict permissions (0600) on the copied files to ensure security.

Goal: Every node now has its own SSL certificate and key for HTTPS.

3️⃣ Deploy Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2.4

Scope: Runs locally (localhost) because the setup.sh installer handles all the remote nodes.

Steps:

Ensure the AAP setup bundle directory exists.

Run the setup.sh installer with:

Path to inventory file.

Admin password (admin_password) from your vault.

PostgreSQL password (pg_password) from your vault.

SSL certs for Controller (controller01) and Hub (hub01).

Environment variables ensure:

Colored output.

Ansible errors on undefined variables.

Proper collection paths for the installer.

Capture and print the setup logs to check for errors or success.

4️⃣ Post-Deployment Health Checks

Scope: Runs locally against the Controller and Hub via HTTPS.

Steps:

Check Controller (controller01.techroute.io):

Perform an HTTPS GET request to the main URL.

Ignore self-signed cert verification (validate_certs: false).

Retry up to 5 times with 10s delay in case the service is still starting.

Check Automation Hub (hub01.techroute.io):

Same as above, but against the Hub URL.

Print results so you know both Controller & Hub are reachable and responding.

✅ Optional next steps after playbook

Once everything works, you can swap self-signed certs for Let’s Encrypt certs for real HTTPS.

You can also add execution nodes and PostgreSQL SSL connections for full enterprise-style deployment.

Finally, you can use the logs and health check results to validate and debug before sharing your LinkedIn ASCII diagram flex.
