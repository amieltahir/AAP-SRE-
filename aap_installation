Here’s a quick sanity checklist before you launch the playbooks:

Nodes:

controller01 – Controller/Task orchestrator
hub01 – Hub node
exec01 – Execution node
db01 – Database node

Connectivity:

Passwordless SSH from controller01 → hub01, exec01, db01
Local VM can SSH into controller01 (or any node) using ~/.ssh/config.

Prerequisites:

You have the AAP 2.4 installer bundles locally on the controller node.
Python 3 installed on all nodes (required for Ansible modules).
Required ports open: 22 (SSH), 80/443 (web), 5432 (Postgres), etc.

Inventory:
Already simplified: just hostnames (controller01, hub01, exec01, db01) because SSH config handles IPs and keys.

Ansible Playbooks:

You can start with a playbook that uploads the installer bundles to each node.
Then a second playbook to run the installation: controller first, database, hub, then execution nodes.
Ensure idempotency: if a playbook fails, you can rerun without breaking the setup.

Local VM:

Use your simplified inventory and SSH config.
No --private-key needed since SSH config has the key path.
